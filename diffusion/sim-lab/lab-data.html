  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <ul class="intro-list">
      <li>A selectively permeable (semipermeable) membrane only allows certain molecules through and blocks others.</li>
      <li>Osmotic pressure is influenced by changes in nonpermeable solute concentration.</li>
      <li>Higher nonpermeable solute concentration increases the amount of water that will cross the membrane. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul class="intro-list">
    <li>In this simulation, you will examine osmosis using thistle tubes that are fitted with membranes over their large, open ends.</li> 
    <li>
    You will place different solutions in thistle tubes and beakers, and then record changes in the volume of water moved by osmosis.

    <question id="1" correct="1" q="Why is this called a selectively permeable membrane?">
      <choice id="1">
        <text>Because it allows small molecules, like water, to pass through but not larger molecules, like those in corn syrup.</text>
        <feedback>Correct. The membrane has holes only large enough to allow water to freely pass back and forth</feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice id="2">
        <text>Because it allows any molecule to selectively choose what side of the membrane to move towards.</text>
        <feedback>Incorrect. Only water can move from one side to the other; larger molecules cannot.</feedback>
